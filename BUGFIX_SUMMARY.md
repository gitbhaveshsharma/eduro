# Session Management Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stale Session After Idle Time
**Symptom:** CRUD operations hang after waiting 10-20 seconds

**Root Cause:** Session tokens expired but weren't being refreshed properly

**Solution:**
- Let Supabase handle auto-refresh automatically
- Only manually refresh when token < 1 minute from expiry
- Trust Supabase's built-in refresh mechanism

### 2. Event Listener Spam
**Symptom:** Multiple validation calls per second, console log spam

**Root Cause:** Duplicate event listeners being added on each module reload

**Solution:**
- Added `isInitialized` flag to prevent duplicate listeners
- Store listener references for proper cleanup
- Unsubscribe from auth changes on cleanup
- Added 3-second debounce between validations

## Files Modified

1. **lib/supabase.ts** - Removed custom storage override
2. **lib/auth-session.ts** - Fixed event listeners and debouncing
3. **lib/api-interceptor.ts** - Removed aggressive validation calls

## Key Improvements

✅ No more hanging operations after idle time
✅ Clean console logs (no spam)
✅ Proper event listener cleanup
✅ Trust Supabase's auto-refresh
✅ Better performance (fewer network calls)

## Testing

1. Open website
2. Wait 20-30 seconds
3. Update role in onboarding
4. Should work without hanging
5. Console should be clean (no spam)
