# Age Validation Fix - Onboarding Issue

## Problem Identified
The user had a profile with:
- `date_of_birth: '2022-11-11'` (approximately 2-3 years old)
- `role: 'S'` (Student)
- `onboarding_level: '3'`

This should have triggered age validation error since Students must be 5-26 years old, but the user was able to proceed without validation.

## Root Causes
1. **No validation on profile load**: Age validation was only happening in `handleNext`, not when existing profile data was loaded
2. **Missing validation in container**: The `handlePersonalInfoNext` function in the container didn't validate age before updating the profile
3. **Button enablement**: The Next button wasn't properly disabled when age validation failed
4. **Incomplete role loading**: The role wasn't being loaded properly from existing profile in some cases

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Validation on Component Mount
```typescript
// Validate existing date of birth when component loads or when role/dob changes
useEffect(() => {
    if (dateOfBirth && userRole) {
        console.log('üîç Validating DOB:', dateOfBirth, 'for role:', userRole)
        const age = calculateAge(dateOfBirth)
        const ageError = validateAge(dateOfBirth, userRole)
        if (ageError) {
            setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, date_of_birth: ageError }))
            showErrorToast(ageError)
        } else {
            setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, date_of_birth: '' }))
        }
    }
}, [dateOfBirth, userRole])
```

### 2. Enhanced Button Validation
```typescript
<Button
    onClick={handleNext}
    disabled={!fullName.trim() || !dateOfBirth || !!errors.date_of_birth || !!errors.full_name || loading}
    className="min-w-[120px]"
>
```

### 3. Added Container-Level Validation
```typescript
const handlePersonalInfoNext = async () => {
    // Validate age before proceeding
    const age = calculateAge(dateOfBirth)
    if (selectedRole === 'S' && (age < 5 || age > 26)) {
        showErrorToast('Students must be between 5 and 26 years old')
        return
    }
    if ((selectedRole === 'T' || selectedRole === 'C') && age < 15) {
        showErrorToast('Teachers and Coaches must be at least 15 years old')
        return
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### 4. Improved Profile Data Loading
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    if (currentProfile) {
        if (currentProfile.role) { // Load all roles, not just non-Student roles
            setSelectedRole(currentProfile.role)
        }
        if (currentProfile.full_name) {
            setFullName(currentProfile.full_name)
        }
        if (currentProfile.date_of_birth) {
            setDateOfBirth(currentProfile.date_of_birth)
        }
    }
}, [currentProfile])
```

### 5. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Added prominent error boxes with red styling for validation errors
- Added success boxes with green styling for valid ages
- Added debugging console logs to track validation flow
- Made age requirements more visible in the UI

## Testing the Fix

### Current User Profile Issue
The user with DOB '2022-11-11' (age ~2-3) and role 'S' should now:
1. ‚úÖ See an immediate age validation error when the form loads
2. ‚úÖ Have the Next button disabled
3. ‚úÖ See a prominent red error message explaining the issue
4. ‚ùå NOT be able to proceed to the next step

### Expected Behavior
- **Students (5-26 years)**: Can proceed normally
- **Teachers/Coaches (21+ years)**: Can proceed normally
- **Invalid ages**: Blocked with clear error messages

## Files Modified
1. `components/onboarding/personal-info-step.tsx` - Enhanced validation and UI feedback
2. `components/onboarding/onboarding-container.tsx` - Added container-level validation
3. `lib/utils/age-validation.ts` - Created utility functions for age validation

## Database Migration
The `date_of_birth` field was added via migration `010_add_date_of_birth.sql`.

## Next Steps
1. Test with the problematic user profile
2. Consider adding server-side validation as well
3. Update existing invalid profiles in the database
4. Add admin tools to review age validation issues
