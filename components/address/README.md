## üéØ Role-Based Address Type Restrictions

### Implementation Details

```typescript
const ALL_ADDRESS_TYPES = [
    { value: 'HOME', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'S', 'T', 'C'] },     // All users
    { value: 'HOSTEL', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'S'] },             // Students only
    { value: 'SCHOOL', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'S'] },             // Students only
    { value: 'COLLEGE', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'S'] },            // Students only
    { value: 'WORK', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'T', 'C'] },          // Teachers & Coaches
    { value: 'OFFICE', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'T', 'C'] },        // Teachers & Coaches
    { value: 'COACHING', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'C'] },           // Coaches only
    { value: 'BRANCH', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'C'] },             // Coaches only
    { value: 'OTHER', allowedRoles: ['SA', 'A', 'S', 'T', 'C'] },    // All users
];
```

### Why This Matters

- **Students** don't need COACHING or BRANCH addresses (those are for coaching centers)
- **Students** don't need WORK or OFFICE addresses (they're students)
- **Teachers** don't need SCHOOL, COLLEGE, HOSTEL, COACHING, or BRANCH addresses
- **Coaches** can have COACHING and BRANCH addresses for their coaching centers
- **Admins** can create any type (for system management)

## üîå Integration Examples

### 1. User Profile Settings
```tsx
import { AddressManager } from '@/components/address';

export function ProfileSettings() {
    return (
        <AddressManager
            showAddButton={true}
            allowEdit={true}
            allowDelete={true}
            allowSetPrimary={true}
            maxAddresses={5}
        />

import { PublicAddressDisplay } from '@/components/address';

export function CoachingProfile({ centerId }) {
    return (
        <PublicAddressDisplay
            coachingId={centerId}
            title="Center Location"
            showMap={true}
            showDirections={true}

```

### 3. Branch Profile
```tsx
import { PublicAddressDisplay } from '@/components/address';

export function BranchProfile({ branchId }) {
    return (
        <PublicAddressDisplay
            branchId={branchId}
            title="Branch Address"

            <CardContent>
                <h3>{center.name}</h3>
                <PublicAddressDisplay
                    coachingId={center.id}
                    compact={true}
                    showMap={true}

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

The address system uses the `addresses` table with:
- `user_id`: Owner of the address
- `branch_id`: Link to coaching branch (nullable)
- `address_type`: Type enum (HOME, WORK, SCHOOL, etc.)
- `label`: Custom label
- Location fields (state, district, city, pin_code, etc.)
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Google Maps integration (maps_url, place_id, plus_code)
- Status flags (is_primary, is_active, is_verified)

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Role-Based Filtering**: Address types automatically filtered by user role
2. **Smart Validation**: PIN code, coordinates, Google Maps URL validation
3. **Google Maps Integration**: Extract coordinates from Maps URL automatically
4. **Primary Address**: One primary address per user, enforced
5. **Soft Delete**: Addresses are deactivated, not permanently deleted
6. **Completion Tracking**: Track address completion percentage
7. **Public/Private Views**: Different views for owner vs public viewing
8. **Caching**: Smart caching with Zustand for performance
9. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, reverts on error
10. **Search & Filter**: Powerful search with filters and pagination

## üìù Usage Notes

1. **Profile Import**: Uses `useCurrentProfile()` from `@/lib/profile`
2. **Role Detection**: Automatically detects user role and filters options
3. **Validation**: All forms include comprehensive validation
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
5. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout
6. **Responsive**: All components are mobile-friendly

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add address to onboarding flow for all users
2. Link addresses to coaching centers in coaching service
3. Add address autocomplete using Google Places API
4. Implement address verification system
5. Add bulk address import for coaching centers
6. Create address analytics dashboard
