# Reaction System Duplicate Key Error Fix

## Issue Summary
Users were encountering a 409 Conflict error when toggling reactions on posts:
```
POST https://ixhlpassuqmqpzpumkuw.supabase.co/rest/v1/post_reactions 409 (Conflict)
Failed to update reaction: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "post_reactions_user_id_target_type_target_id_key"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Schema
The `post_reactions` table has a unique constraint:
```sql
UNIQUE(user_id, target_type, target_id)
```

This ensures a user can only have ONE reaction per target (post or comment), but they can change which reaction they've given.

### The Problem
The previous `PostService.toggleReaction` implementation had a critical flaw:

**Old Logic:**
1. Check if user has the **exact same reaction** (checking `reaction_id` too)
2. If not found, try to INSERT
3. **PROBLEM:** User might already have a DIFFERENT reaction on that target
4. INSERT fails because of unique constraint violation

**Example Failure Scenario:**
```
1. User has üëç (reaction_id: 1) on Post A
2. User clicks ‚ù§Ô∏è (reaction_id: 2) 
3. Code checks: "Does user have ‚ù§Ô∏è on Post A?" ‚Üí No
4. Code tries: INSERT (user, POST, Post A, 2)
5. Database rejects: User already has a reaction on Post A!
```

### Database Function Solution
The database already had a proper `toggle_reaction` function that handles this correctly:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION toggle_reaction(
    target_type_param reaction_target_type,
    target_id_param UUID,
    reaction_id_param INTEGER
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

**Correct Logic:**
1. Check if user has **ANY** reaction on target (ignoring reaction_id)
2. If found AND same reaction ‚Üí DELETE (toggle off)
3. If found AND different reaction ‚Üí UPDATE to new reaction
4. If not found ‚Üí INSERT new reaction

This is handled atomically in a single transaction, preventing race conditions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated PostService.toggleReaction
**File:** `lib/service/post.service.ts`

Changed from manual INSERT/DELETE logic to using the database RPC function:

```typescript
// Use the database's toggle_reaction RPC function which handles all logic atomically
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('toggle_reaction', {
  target_type_param: targetType,
  target_id_param: targetId,
  reaction_id_param: reactionId
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Atomic operation (no race conditions)
- ‚úÖ Properly handles reaction switching
- ‚úÖ Correctly implements toggle behavior
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate key errors

### 2. Updated Feed Container to Refresh Analytics
**File:** `components/feed/feed-container.tsx`

Added analytics refresh after reaction toggle:

```typescript
// Reload reaction analytics to update the UI
const { useReactionStore } = await import('@/lib/reaction');
const loadReactionAnalytics = useReactionStore.getState().loadReactionAnalytics;
await loadReactionAnalytics('POST', postId, true); // force refresh
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ UI updates immediately after reaction changes
- ‚úÖ Reaction counts are accurate
- ‚úÖ User sees their reaction reflected instantly

### 3. Updated Comment Documentation
**File:** `components/reactions/post-reactions.tsx`

Clarified the behavior in comments:

```typescript
const handleReactionSelect = (reaction: PublicReaction) => {
    // When user selects a reaction from the bar or picker
    // This will either add the reaction or switch to it if they had a different one
    onReactionChange?.(reaction, 'add');
};

const handleReactionClick = (reaction: PublicReaction) => {
    // When user clicks on an existing reaction chip
    // This will toggle it (remove if it's theirs, or switch to it)
    onReactionChange?.(reaction, 'remove');
};
```

## Reaction Flow

### Component Hierarchy
```
PostCard
  ‚îî‚îÄ PostReactions
      ‚îî‚îÄ ReactionDisplay (shows existing reactions with hover-triggered ReactionBar)
          ‚îî‚îÄ ReactionBar (quick reactions + picker button)
              ‚îî‚îÄ ReactionPicker (full reaction selection modal)
```

### Interaction Flow
1. **User hovers over reactions** ‚Üí ReactionBar appears after 200ms
2. **User clicks reaction from bar** ‚Üí `handleReactionSelect` ‚Üí `onReactionChange` ‚Üí `PostService.toggleReaction`
3. **User clicks existing reaction chip** ‚Üí `handleReactionClick` ‚Üí `onReactionChange` ‚Üí `PostService.toggleReaction`
4. **Database processes** ‚Üí `toggle_reaction` function handles all logic
5. **Response received** ‚Üí Analytics refresh ‚Üí UI updates

### Toggle Behavior Matrix

| Current State | User Action | Database Function | Result | Return Value |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|--------------|
| No reaction | Click ‚ù§Ô∏è | INSERT | ‚ù§Ô∏è added | TRUE |
| Has ‚ù§Ô∏è | Click ‚ù§Ô∏è | DELETE | Reaction removed | FALSE |
| Has ‚ù§Ô∏è | Click üëç | UPDATE | ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Üí üëç | TRUE |
| Has üëç | Click ‚ù§Ô∏è | UPDATE | üëç ‚Üí ‚ù§Ô∏è | TRUE |

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [x] User can add a reaction to a post
- [x] User can remove their reaction (click same reaction)
- [x] User can switch reactions (click different reaction)
- [x] Reaction counts update correctly
- [x] UI shows user's current reaction highlighted

### Edge Cases
- [x] Rapid clicking doesn't cause duplicates
- [x] Multiple users reacting to same post works
- [x] Switching between reactions doesn't error
- [x] Network errors are handled gracefully

### Performance
- [x] No duplicate API calls
- [x] Analytics refresh is efficient
- [x] UI updates are smooth and responsive

## Database Triggers

The system also has triggers that automatically update counts:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_engagement_counts_on_reaction
    AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON post_reactions 
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_engagement_counts();
```

This ensures:
- `posts.like_count` is automatically updated
- `posts.engagement_score` is recalculated
- `posts.last_activity_at` is updated

## Error Handling

### Before Fix
```
409 Conflict
duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ No more 409 errors
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages if reaction doesn't exist
- ‚úÖ Authentication errors handled
- ‚úÖ Network errors logged and displayed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Atomic Operations:** Using RPC function ensures single database roundtrip
2. **Analytics Caching:** Reaction store caches analytics to avoid excessive queries
3. **Optimistic Updates:** Could be added in future for even better UX
4. **Debouncing:** Not needed as each click is intentional and atomic

## Future Enhancements

1. **Optimistic Updates:** Update UI immediately, revert on error
2. **Real-time Subscriptions:** Watch for other users' reactions
3. **Reaction Animations:** Celebrate when reactions are added
4. **Reaction History:** Track user's reaction changes over time
5. **Batch Operations:** Allow reacting to multiple posts at once

## Conclusion

The duplicate key error was caused by a mismatch between the application logic (checking for exact reaction match) and the database constraint (allowing only one reaction per user per target). 

By switching to the database's `toggle_reaction` RPC function, we now have:
- ‚úÖ Atomic operations
- ‚úÖ Proper reaction switching
- ‚úÖ No duplicate key errors
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code
- ‚úÖ Better user experience

The fix is minimal, focused, and leverages the existing database infrastructure correctly.
