# Network Discovery Page Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **ProfileAPI.searchProfiles Timing Issue**
**Problem**: The `ProfileAPI.searchProfiles` method was calling the store but returning stale `store.searchResults`, causing filter changes to show delayed or incorrect results.

**Fix**: Modified `lib/profile.ts` to call `ProfileService.searchProfiles` directly instead of using the store, ensuring fresh results every time.

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
static async searchProfiles(...) {
  const store = useProfileStore.getState();
  await store.searchProfiles(filters, sort, page, perPage);
  return store.searchResults; // ← Could be stale
}

// After (fixed)
static async searchProfiles(...) {
  const { ProfileService } = await import('./service/profile.service');
  const result = await ProfileService.searchProfiles(filters, sort, page, perPage);
  
  if (result.success && result.data) {
    return result.data;
  } else {
    throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to search profiles');
  }
}
```

### 2. **Missing Initial Load on Page Mount**
**Problem**: The NetworkDiscovery component wasn't loading profiles on initial mount, causing empty state until user interacted with filters.

**Fix**: Added initial load effect in `components/network/network-discovery.tsx`:

```typescript
// Added initial mount effect
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🟢 NetworkDiscovery - Initial mount, loading profiles...');
  
  fetchProfiles(
    1,
    false,
    externalSearchQuery,
    externalSelectedRole,
    externalSelectedSort,
    externalShowVerifiedOnly,
    externalShowOnlineOnly
  );
}, []); // Only run on mount
```

### 3. **Filter State Synchronization Issues**
**Problem**: Filter changes weren't properly triggering immediate updates, causing delayed responses when selecting roles or changing filters.

**Fix**: 
- Improved filter change effect with better logging and always reset to page 1
- Fixed boolean filter handling to avoid `undefined` values
- Added debugging throughout the chain (Layout → Header → NetworkDiscovery → ProfileService)

```typescript
// Improved filter building
const profileFilters: ProfileFilters = {};

// Only add filters if they have meaningful values
if (searchQuery && searchQuery.trim()) {
  profileFilters.search_query = searchQuery.trim();
}

if (selectedRole && selectedRole !== 'all') {
  profileFilters.role = selectedRole as any;
}

if (showVerifiedOnly === true) {
  profileFilters.is_verified = true;
}

if (showOnlineOnly === true) {
  profileFilters.is_online = true;
}
```

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**
Added logging throughout the entire filter chain to track issues:

- **NetworkLayout**: Logs when filter state changes
- **NetworkHeader**: Logs when user interactions trigger changes
- **NetworkDiscovery**: Logs when effects fire and API calls are made
- **ProfileService**: Logs query construction and results

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/profile.ts`** - Fixed ProfileAPI.searchProfiles method
2. **`components/network/network-discovery.tsx`** - Added initial load and improved filter handling
3. **`app/(community)/network/layout.tsx`** - Added debugging for filter changes
4. **`components/layout/headers/network-header.tsx`** - Added debugging for user interactions
5. **`lib/service/profile.service.ts`** - Added debugging for query construction

## Testing Instructions

1. **Initial Load Test**: 
   - Navigate to `/network` or refresh the page
   - Should immediately show profiles without requiring interaction

2. **Role Filter Test**:
   - Select different roles (Student, Teacher, Coach, Admin)
   - Should immediately filter results without delay

3. **Search Test**:
   - Type in search box
   - Should debounce (500ms) then show filtered results
   - Clear search should immediately show all results

4. **Sort Test**:
   - Change sort options (Recently Joined, Name A-Z, etc.)
   - Should immediately re-sort results

5. **Combined Filters Test**:
   - Apply multiple filters together (role + search + verified)
   - Should show results matching ALL applied filters

## Debug Console Output

When testing, check browser console for logs:
- 🟣 NetworkLayout logs (filter state changes)
- 🔵 NetworkHeader logs (user interactions)
- 🟡/🔵 NetworkDiscovery logs (effects and API calls)
- 🟪 ProfileService logs (query construction and results)

## Performance Considerations

- Search queries are debounced by 500ms to avoid excessive API calls
- Non-search filter changes trigger immediate updates
- ProfileAPI now bypasses store for direct results (no caching delays)
- All effects properly clean up timers to prevent memory leaks

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for the debug logs
2. Verify Supabase database has proper role data ('S', 'T', 'C', 'A')
3. Test with different user accounts and roles
4. Monitor network tab for API request/response details
