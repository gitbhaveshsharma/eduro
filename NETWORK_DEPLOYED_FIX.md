# Network Page Deployed Environment Fix

## Problem

The network page was showing "Finding users that match your criteria..." indefinitely on the deployed version (Netlify) but working fine locally. No users were being displayed, and no filters were working.

### Symptoms
- ✅ **Localhost**: Network page shows users, filters work correctly
- ❌ **Deployed (Netlify)**: Shows loading message indefinitely, no users displayed
- ❌ Filters (Role, Sort, Search) not working on deployed version
- ❌ No console errors visible to the user

## Root Causes

### 1. **Server-Side Client Issue**
The `ProfileService` was using the browser Supabase client (`createClient()`) which doesn't work in server-side rendering contexts. When the Next.js server component tried to fetch initial profiles, it failed silently because:
- Browser client requires `window` object
- Server doesn't have `window` object
- No proper error handling for this case

### 2. **Initial Load Logic Issue**
The `NetworkDiscovery` component had logic that prevented fetching on the client if it thought it had initial data:
```typescript
// Old logic - problematic
if (!isMounted.current) {
    isMounted.current = true;
    return; // Skip initial fetch
}
```

When server-side fetch failed (returned empty array), the client component received empty `initialProfiles` but still skipped the initial fetch, resulting in no users being displayed.

### 3. **Missing Environment Variables Detection**
The server-side code wasn't checking if environment variables were properly configured for the deployed environment.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Dynamic Supabase Client Selection
**File**: `lib/service/profile.service.ts`

Added a function to detect the environment and use the appropriate Supabase client:

```typescript
/**
 * Get the appropriate Supabase client based on environment
 * - Server-side (SSR): Use server client with cookies
 * - Client-side: Use browser client
 */
async function getSupabaseClient() {
  // Check if we're on the server
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
    console.log('🟣 ProfileService - Using server client');
    // Server-side: use server client
    const { createServerClient } = await import('../supabase/server');
    return await createServerClient();
  } else {
    console.log('🔵 ProfileService - Using browser client');
    // Client-side: use browser client
    return createClient();
  }
}
```

Then updated `searchProfiles` to use this:
```typescript
static async searchProfiles(...) {
  // Get the appropriate client for the environment
  const supabase = await getSupabaseClient();
  
  let query = supabase.from('profiles')...
}
```

### Fix 2: Improved Initial Load Logic
**File**: `components/network/network-discovery.tsx`

Added separate effect for initial load that checks if profiles are empty:

```typescript
const [hasInitialLoad, setHasInitialLoad] = useState(false);

/**
 * Effect: Initial load - fetch profiles on mount if no initial data provided
 */
useEffect(() => {
    // Only run once on mount
    if (hasInitialLoad) return;

    console.log('🟢 NetworkDiscovery - Initial mount check:', {
        hasInitialProfiles: initialProfiles.length > 0,
        profilesInState: profiles.length,
    });

    // If we have no profiles from server, fetch immediately on client
    if (profiles.length === 0) {
        console.log('🟢 NetworkDiscovery - No initial profiles, fetching on client...');
        fetchProfiles(...);
    }

    setHasInitialLoad(true);
}, []); // Run only once on mount
```

This ensures:
- ✅ If server provides profiles → use them
- ✅ If server fails → client fetches immediately
- ✅ Filters still work independently

### Fix 3: Enhanced Error Logging
**Files**: 
- `app/(community)/network/page.tsx`
- `lib/profile.ts`
- `components/network/network-page-client.tsx`

Added comprehensive logging at every step:

```typescript
// Server page
console.log('🟣 NetworkPage (Server) - Starting initial profile fetch...');
console.log('🟣 Environment check:', {
    hasSupabaseUrl: !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    hasSupabaseKey: !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
});

// Client component
console.log('🔷 NetworkPageClient - Received initial profiles:', {
    count: initialProfiles?.length || 0,
    hasProfiles: (initialProfiles?.length || 0) > 0,
});

// ProfileAPI
console.log('🟠 ProfileAPI.searchProfiles - Called with:', { filters, sort, page, perPage });
console.log('🟠 ProfileAPI.searchProfiles - Service result:', {
    success: result.success,
    profileCount: result.data?.profiles?.length || 0,
    error: result.error,
});
```

This helps diagnose:
- Where the failure occurs (server vs client)
- If environment variables are missing
- If API calls succeed or fail
- How many profiles are returned at each step

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Netlify, ensure:

### 1. Environment Variables
Verify these are set in Netlify's environment variables:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables**

### 2. Build Settings
Verify build command in `netlify.toml` or Netlify dashboard:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
```

### 3. Check Logs
After deployment, check Netlify function logs for server-side errors:
- Netlify Dashboard → Functions → View logs
- Look for 🟣 (server) and 🔴 (error) emoji logs

### 4. Browser Console
Open network page on deployed site and check console:
- Should see 🔷 log showing initial profiles received
- Should see 🔵 logs showing client fetching
- Should see 🟢 logs showing successful profile display

## Testing

### Test 1: Initial Load
1. Navigate to `/network` on deployed site
2. Should see users immediately (or loading, then users)
3. Check console for 🟢 logs

### Test 2: Role Filter
1. Click "Users" dropdown
2. Select "Students" or "Teachers"
3. Should see filtered results immediately
4. Check console for 🟡 filter change logs

### Test 3: Search
1. Type a name in search box
2. Wait 500ms (debounce)
3. Should see filtered results
4. Check console for search logs

### Test 4: Sort
1. Click "Filter" dropdown
2. Select "Name (A-Z)"
3. Should see results re-sorted
4. Check console for sort logs

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist after deployment:

### Quick Rollback
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Click "Deploys"
3. Find previous working deployment
4. Click "Publish deploy"

### Alternative: Disable SSR Fetch
If server-side fetch continues to fail, you can disable it temporarily:

**File**: `app/(community)/network/page.tsx`
```typescript
export default async function NetworkPage() {
    // Temporarily disable server fetch
    const initialProfiles: any[] = [];
    
    // Client will handle all fetching
    return <NetworkPageClient initialProfiles={initialProfiles} />;
}
```

This forces all fetching to happen on the client side, which we know works.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/service/profile.service.ts` - Dynamic client selection
2. ✅ `components/network/network-discovery.tsx` - Improved initial load
3. ✅ `app/(community)/network/page.tsx` - Enhanced error logging
4. ✅ `lib/profile.ts` - Enhanced error logging
5. ✅ `components/network/network-page-client.tsx` - Added logging
6. ✅ `NETWORK_DEPLOYED_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### On Localhost
- ✅ Server fetches initial profiles
- ✅ Client receives and displays them
- ✅ Filters work immediately

### On Deployed Site (Netlify)
- ✅ Server fetches initial profiles (if env vars configured)
- ✅ If server fetch fails, client fetches automatically
- ✅ Users see profiles within 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Filters work immediately
- ✅ No infinite loading state

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- Server-side errors in Netlify function logs
- Client-side errors in browser console
- User reports of loading issues
- Check that environment variables persist across deployments

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Health Check Endpoint**
   - Create `/api/health` endpoint
   - Test Supabase connectivity
   - Return status of server-side client

2. **Add Fallback UI**
   - Show "Server unavailable, using client fetch" message
   - Better error states for network failures

3. **Add Retry Logic**
   - Retry failed server fetches
   - Exponential backoff for client fetches

4. **Cache Initial Results**
   - Use Next.js caching for initial profile fetch
   - Reduce server load and improve performance

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Contact the development team with logs
