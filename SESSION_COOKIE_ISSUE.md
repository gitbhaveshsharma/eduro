# Session Cookie Issue - Analysis & Next Steps

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **No more "Dynamic server usage" error** - Dashboard now forces dynamic rendering correctly
2. **Middleware detects auth** - Can see user ID in middleware logs
3. **Single cookie source** - Middleware is only place that writes cookies
4. **Code architecture** - Clean separation of concerns

### ❌ What's Broken:
**Server components can't read the session even though middleware refreshed it**

## Logs Analysis

```
[AUTH] Cookie found: true
[AUTH] Access token found: true
Auth Event: userId: 'f604bdf3-4765-426f-b53d-3b2c69df7162'  <- Middleware sees user
...
Dashboard: Starting server-side profile fetch
Server: No session found: null  <- Server component doesn't see session
```

## Root Cause

The issue is that **Next.js middleware and Server Components don't share the same request context perfectly**. Here's what's happening:

1. Middleware creates Supabase client → refreshes session → updates RESPONSE cookies
2. Middleware returns response with fresh cookies
3. Server Component runs → creates NEW Supabase client → tries to read RESPONSE cookies
4. **But server component reads from REQUEST cookies, not response cookies!**

## Why This Happens

In Next.js App Router:
- Middleware modifies `NextResponse` cookies
- Server Components read from `NextRequest` cookies (via `cookies()` function)
- These are DIFFERENT cookie stores during the same request
- Response cookies haven't been "committed" yet when server component runs

## The Fix

We have TWO options:

### Option 1: Use Request Headers (Recommended)
Pass user info via headers from middleware to server components:

```typescript
// middleware.ts
if (user) {
  response.headers.set('x-user-id', user.id)
  response.headers.set('x-supabase-token', accessToken) // Pass token through
}

// server component
const userId = headers().get('x-user-id')
const token = headers().get('x-supabase-token')
// Create Supabase client with this token
```

### Option 2: Redirect to API Route
Create an API route that handles profile fetching:

```typescript
// app/api/profile/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const supabase = getSupabaseServerClient(cookies())
  const profile = await ProfileServerService.getCurrentProfile()
  return NextResponse.json({ profile })
}

// Dashboard fetches from this API
```

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1** because:
- Faster (no extra network request)
- Keeps data fetching in server component
- Headers are set during middleware, available in server components
- Single request flow

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify middleware to pass access token via header
2. Create a helper that reconstructs Supabase client with token from header
3. Update Profile Server Service to use this helper
4. Test that dashboard now loads profile correctly

## Why This is Better

Before: Middleware refreshes → cookies go to response → server component can't see them → NULL
After: Middleware refreshes → sets headers → server component reads headers → SUCCESS

Headers are **synchronously** available to server components, cookies from responses are not!
