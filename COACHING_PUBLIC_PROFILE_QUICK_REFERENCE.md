- Review integration is **ready** but needs review data to be present
- Address integration is **ready** but needs DB schema update
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Loading states are implemented
- Empty states are user-friendly

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODO

1. **Branch-Address Link**: Need to add address_id to branch table or metadata
2. **Manager Profile**: Need to load manager profile data if needed
3. **Review Aggregation**: Currently loads reviews for first branch only
4. **Follow System**: Backend implementation pending
5. **Admission Flow**: Not yet implemented

## 📖 Documentation

Full documentation available in:
