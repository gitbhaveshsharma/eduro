# Post Reaction Performance Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Thundering Herd Problem on Page Refresh**

**Problem**: When users refreshed the page, every component would subscribe simultaneously and trigger multiple network requests at once, causing slow initial loads.

**Solution**: Implemented batch loading and staggered requests.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added Batch Loading to PostReactionStore**:
   - Added `pendingBatchLoad: Set<string>` to track pending load requests
   - Added `batchLoadTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | null` for batching window
   - Created `processBatchLoad()` method to process batched requests

2. **Updated `subscribeToTarget()` Method**:
   - Instead of immediate loading, adds requests to batch queue
   - Sets up a 150ms batch window for collecting multiple subscription requests
   - Processes all pending loads with 25ms stagger between each

3. **Smart Cache Checking**:
   - Only loads data if cache is stale (older than 5 minutes)
   - Checks if subscription is still active before loading
   - Prevents unnecessary network requests

```typescript
// Before: Immediate load on subscription
get().loadUserReaction(targetType, targetId, true);

// After: Batched load with smart caching
set((draft) => {
  draft.pendingBatchLoad.add(cacheKey);
  if (!draft.batchLoadTimer) {
    draft.batchLoadTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      get().processBatchLoad();
    }, 150);
  }
});
```

### 2. **Reaction Count Flashing to 0**

**Problem**: When users added reactions, the UI would briefly show 0 reactions before updating to the correct count due to cache invalidation happening before new data was loaded.

**Solution**: Implemented optimistic updates that preserve existing data during reload.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `handleReactionUpdate()` Method**:
   - Removed immediate cache invalidation
   - Loads new data directly without clearing existing cache first
   - Preserves UI state during updates

2. **Added Optimistic Analytics Reload**:
   - Created `reloadAnalyticsOptimistically()` method in ReactionStore
   - Loads new data and only updates cache if successful
   - Preserves existing analytics data during loading

3. **Reduced Update Delay**:
   - Reduced timeout from 100ms to 50ms for faster updates
   - Ensures UI updates quickly without showing intermediate states

```typescript
// Before: Cache cleared first, causing UI flash
get().invalidateCache(update.targetType, update.targetId);
get().loadUserReaction(update.targetType, update.targetId, true);

// After: Direct reload preserving existing data
get().loadUserReaction(update.targetType, update.targetId, true);
await reactionStore.reloadAnalyticsOptimistically(update.targetType, update.targetId);
```

## Performance Improvements

### Page Load Performance
- **Batched Loading**: Multiple subscriptions now batch into single timed window
- **Cache Reuse**: Fresh cache data is preserved, reducing redundant network calls
- **Staggered Requests**: When batch loads execute, they're staggered by 25ms to prevent server overload

### Real-time Update Performance  
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately without showing loading states
- **Preserved Data**: Existing reaction counts remain visible during updates
- **Faster Response**: Reduced delays from 100ms to 50ms for quicker feedback

### Network Request Optimization
- **Smart Caching**: Only loads data when cache is actually stale (5+ minutes old)
- **Deduplication**: Prevents multiple requests for the same target
- **Subscription Reuse**: Real-time channels are shared efficiently via PostReactionService

## Technical Details

### Batch Loading Flow
1. Component subscribes → Added to batch queue
2. Batch timer starts (150ms window)
3. Additional subscriptions added to same batch
4. Timer fires → Process all pending loads with stagger
5. Each load checks cache freshness before executing

### Optimistic Update Flow
1. Real-time update received
2. Start loading new data immediately (preserving existing)
3. Load new analytics optimistically
4. Update UI only when new data arrives
5. No intermediate "empty" states shown

### Cache Strategy
- **TTL**: 5 minutes for reaction data
- **Preservation**: Existing data kept during updates
- **Smart Invalidation**: Only clear cache after successful reload
- **Targeted Updates**: Only affected targets are updated, not entire cache

## Usage

The fixes are automatic and require no changes to existing component code. Components using:

- `usePostReactionStore()`
- `useReactionSubscription()`
- `PostReactions` component
- `ReactionDisplay` component

Will automatically benefit from these performance improvements.

## Debugging

### Check Active Subscriptions
```typescript
const store = usePostReactionStore.getState();
console.log('Active subscriptions:', store.getSubscriptionCount());
console.log('Channel status:', store.getChannelStatus());
```

### Check Batch Loading Status
```typescript
const store = usePostReactionStore.getState();
console.log('Pending batch loads:', store.pendingBatchLoad.size);
console.log('Batch timer active:', !!store.batchLoadTimer);
```

### Monitor Analytics Updates
```typescript
const reactionStore = useReactionStore.getState();
const analytics = reactionStore.analyticsCache.get('POST:your-post-id');
console.log('Current analytics:', analytics);
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/store/post-reaction.store.ts`**:
   - Added batch loading state and methods
   - Updated subscription management
   - Improved real-time update handling

2. **`lib/store/reaction.store.ts`**:
   - Added optimistic analytics reload method
   - Enhanced cache management
   - Preserved data during updates

These changes ensure a smooth, responsive user experience without the performance issues that occurred during page refreshes and reaction updates.
